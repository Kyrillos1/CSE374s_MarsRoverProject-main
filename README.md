# CSE374s_MarsRoverProject-main

We are going to control the robot from images streamed from a camera mounted on the robot
using image processing algorithms. The project aims to do autonomous mapping and navigation
given an initial map of the environment.
We make this by running the simulator first in training mode, and we take sample images of the
world that the rover walks in from the camera that is mounted on the rover. Then, we use
image processing algorithms on this data set to make a world map that the rover can drive
autonomously in .
